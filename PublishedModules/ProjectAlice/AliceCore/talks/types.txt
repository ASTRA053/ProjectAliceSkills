# This file is a list of all talk keys, that are required in the corresponding <language>.json files of the module
# It is used by the validation script, which makes sure each language file of a module includes all required keys
# This is especially helpful when a module has a lot of talk keys, which makes it easy to overlook a newly added key
# It is also useful for modules in which the individual languages are developed by different people, so they can check
# a lot easier whether they need to translate further texts
#
# The syntax of this file is a simple list with one key per line. Empty lines and comments and lines starting with
# a # are ignored and can be used to structure the keys in groups and add comments
